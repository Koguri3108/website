		<p class="centertext">Installing this Language-Pack will change the Language that SSP is displayed in to German.<br>▶Please note that this Language-Pack will NOT change the language of individual Ghosts.◀</p>
		<p class="boldtext">How to install</p>
		<p>To install, simply drag and drop the NAR file onto a Ghost that you have currently open and it will install the Language-Pack for you. You will notice that the installation was successful, when the option "Deutsch" appears under the language tab in the right-click menu. Click on that to change the language to German.</p>
		<p class="boldtext">How to update</p>
		<p>After a successful installation you can update the Language-Pack by opening the SSP-Explorer, which you can open in the right-click-menu under Funktionen/Utilities or by pressing Ctrl+E when you have one of your Ghosts highlighted, then going to Typ/Type->Sprache/Language, right-clicking the Language-Pack and selecting Netzwerk-Update/Network Update.</p>

		<p>It is probably best to try to update the Language-Pack immediately after every SSP Update and again a few days after that since the Language-Pack does not update at the same time SSP does.
		<br>If you want to know more precicely when to update the Language-Pack, you can open it up in its folder via the Explorer and check the version number of the resource.dll file in Properties->Details. Compare it to its English counterpart and if the numbers don't match you can start looking out for an update.</p>
		<br>
		<p>If anything goes wrong, be it during the initial installation process or during updating, or you find any mistakes in the Language-Pack, please contact me on one of my social-medias (links below) or write an email to Koguri.3108@gmx.at.</p>

		<p class="boldtext">Usage Tips</p>
		<p class="linetext">Turn off Menu-Text-Override</p>
		<p>Sometimes Ghosts will override text in the right-click-menu with their own, which will also override the translation.<br>If you still want to see the translated text, you can check the "Ghost-definierten Menü-Text ignorieren"/"Ignore Ghost-defined Menu Strings" checkbox in the Ghost(1) settings in Einstellungen/Preferences.</p>
		<img src="img/MenuText.png" alt="The right-click-menu and the Preferences with arrows to show where to click." width="896" height="681" class="center">
		<p>This will disable the Ghosts ability to override the text in the right-click-menu.</p>
